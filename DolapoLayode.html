    <p align= "center">Personal statement
    Over the past three years in my career so far in finance and accounting, 
    I have developed key transferable skills over the years. Skills such as multitasking, 
    resilience, flexibility, adaptability, great customer services skills, creative problem 
    solving, interpersonal skills, and articulate communication. 
    I take the initiative to get things done and make things happen, 
    which has resulted in being able to meet deadlines comfortably.</p>
